## Examples

AlertScreen is ' Dialog Widget ' so you shoud use inside  `showDialog` like below;

```Dart
    onPressed: () {
                      showDialog(
                          context: context,
                          builder: (context) {
                            return const AlertScreen();
                          });
                    },
```
I prepared 3 types of AlertScreen. These : `warning` , `info` , `done`. 

You can choice these 3 type AlertScreen inside of ' dialogType '.
